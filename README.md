## Food Truck Project

## Overview

Milo's Food truck app will allow a user to input up to five different food trucks. The user is prompted to enter trucks and can stop by entering "quit" for any truck name. The user can then view a list of trucks entered, view highest rated truck, and view average rating of all trucks. User will input truck name, food type, and rating. The food truck will be assigned a truck id and then once all trucks have been entered the user can select from a few options. Options for user to select include, list all trucks, view average rating of all input trucks, and view highest rated truck. When the user is done the user can select quit to enter program.

### Topics/Technologies Used
* Creating class file
* Constructors
* Incrementing static field from Constructors
* Getters and Setters
* toString
* Creating an object through user input
* Storing objects in an array
* Iterating over an array to access various object data fields
* Use of non static methods

### Lesson Learned
While writing the Food Truck Project the lessons learned were many. I learned how to manipulate static data from within the constructor in order to increment to truck id field. While I had a slight understanding of the concept of arrays and objects prior to going in to the weekend, I feel that working with them in great length and getting stuck at multiple points helped to really hammer in a better overall understanding. Accessing data from an object through the array and displaying on screen was sometimes a challenge to figure out and through that struggle have come out with a much better understanding of how that works as well. I was faced will null pointer exceptions throughout many areas of this project, understanding that concept was a little hairy in the beginning but as with many other areas I grew more comfortable with it as I progressed through the project. A huge lesson that I will take away from this is to have distinct and easily readable names for arrays, objects, and variables as there was a point where I felt like everything was named foodTruck. Going in with a plan and writing out the methods in english prior to coding was a huge help.
